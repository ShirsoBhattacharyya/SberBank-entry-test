# SOLVE THIS TASK:
We have input data in "test-data" directory.  
This is some array of json files, which represents matrices of data, some measures which done in some time.  
First column is dateTime â€“ the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT  
Second column is some measure in Integer format  
Data is not sorted  
Also we have ENUM Timeframe which represents set of timeframes(code and milliseconds in frame)  
You should parse ALL input data files(use jackson lib, included in project) and make some data transformation.  
Transformation is: you need build result matrix for each input data file, format is  
[[a,b,c],[a,b,c]... etc]  
where  
a: start millisecond of current timeframe of measure  
b: start millisecond of next frame  
c: average value of measurements which done in that frame, divide operation should be performed with rounding to 2 digits, with "half up" rule.  
avg = (m1+m2+m3+...)/N (where m1,m2,... is measurements and N is measurements count)  
### Please pay attention:   
- if you have no measures in frame, average value for this frame will be 0, and frame should exist in result!   
- Your initial timeframe should encompass a time interval that includes the first chronological measurement of the incoming data array. It should be based on a global coordinate system. For example, if the first measurement is taken at 10:11, then for a 15-minute timeframe, the first interval should start at 10:00. 

### Example 1:  
For input array: [[123,2],[124,6],[60100,8],[60200,2]]  
For M1 timeframe result should be:[[0,60000,4],[60000,120000,5]]  
### Example 2:  
For input array: [[60100,8],[60200,2], [240100,8],[240200,2]]  
For M1 timeframe result should be: [[60000,120000,5],[120000,180000,0],[180000,240000,0],[240000,300000,5]]  

Result file should be written to result-data/%timeFrame.code%/ directory(you can use enum code to get timeframe directory),  
all directories are already provided. File should be with the exact same name as input file, for example:  
Result calculation for file "test-data/data1.json" in H1 timeframe should be written to "result-data/H1/data1.json"*
