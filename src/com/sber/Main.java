        * Requirements:
        *   Java 11
        * POST YOUR CODE HERE!
        * SOLVE THIS TASK:
        * We have input data in "test-data" directory
        * This is some array of json files, which represents matrices of data, some measures which done in some time.
        * First column is dateTime – the milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT(see java.util.Date.Date(long))
        * Second column is some measure in Integer format
        * Also we have ENUM Timeframe which represents set of timeframes(code and milliseconds in frame)
        * You should parse ALL input data files(use jackson lib, included in project) and make some data transformation.
        * Transformation is: you need build result matrix for each input data file, format is
        * [[a,b,c],[a,b,c]... etc]
        * where
        *  a: start millisecond of current timeframe of measure
        *  b: start millisecond of next frame
        *  c: average value of measures which done in that frame, divide operation should be performed with rounding to 2 digits, with "half up" rule.
        *  avg = (m1+m2+m3+...)/N (where m1,m2,... is measurements and N is measurements count)
        *     please pay attention: if you have no measures in frame, average value for this frame will be 0, and frame should exist in result!
        *     if some measure time equals with timeframe start, it should be counted only in timeframe where time equals timeframe start
        * For example:
        * #1
        * For input array: [[123,2],[124,6],[60100,8],[60200,2]]
        * For M1 timeframe result should be:[[0,60000,4],[60000,120000,5]]
        *
        * #2
        * For input array: [[60100,8],[60200,2], [240100,8],[240200,2]]
        * For M1 timeframe result should be: [[60000,120000,5],[120000,180000,0],[180000,240000,0],[240000,300000,5]]
        *
        * Result file should be written to result-data/%timeFrame.code%/ directory(you can use enum code to get timeframe directory),
        * all directories are already provided. File should be with the exact same name as input file, for example:
        * Result calculation for file "test-data/data1.json" in H1 timeframe should be written to "result-data/H1/data1.json"
        *
        * You are not allowed to use any external libraries except provided jackson
        * Please send your code to HR partner with your CV!
